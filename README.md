## Design

This is the front end part of a product management app built with Angular. The js/css library I used is Angular material.

The are two folders under src/app, core and features, common (& shared) components are put under core folder.

The product related compoents/services/models are put under features folder, and I used a module product to declare all components related to product.


# test
Test is my weakness, I did not provide proper unit tests...
